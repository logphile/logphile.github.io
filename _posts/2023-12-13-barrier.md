I use 4 monitors. Two monitors per machine. To use a single keyboard and mouse for both machines I use Barrier. Barrier is software that mimics traditional KVM hardware.

## Install Barrier (Linux)

At the time of this writing, Barrier was being setup on a fresh install of Ubuntu 23.10.

Install Barrier from CLI using:

`sudo apt install barrier`

Choosing Server or Client

In this instance I chose Client, the other machine (Windows 10) is acting as the Barrier Server.

## Turning Off SSL & AutoConfig

By default, *Auto config* will be checked. I have found the *Auto Config* option to be hit or miss. I uncheck this. I have never used SSL with Barrier, seems overkill for my needs. Plus,

{: .prompt-info}

After unchecking *Auto config* I enter the IP address of the machine designated as the Barrier server.

Click __Start__

## SSL Error

The Barrier client (Linux) did not connect to the Barrier server (Windows). The logs show some static around an ssl certificate. The Barrier Server (Windows) does not require an SSL certificate from clients, it never has. The error is originating from the client (Linux).

Even though the prior window showed *SSL Fingerprint: Disabled*, clicking *Barrier*, then *Change Settings* we can see that *Enable SSL* is checked. I forgot this is checked by default. Whoops.

*Enable SSL* turned off

The log is still throwing up errors. The solution is covered in the next post.
