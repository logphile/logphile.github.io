At home, I run 4 monitors. Anyone that runs 4 monitors will tell you that it sounds cooler than it is in practice. Two monitors per machine. To use a single keyboard and mouse to operate both machines I use Barrier. Barrier is software that mimic traditional KVM hardware.

## Install (Linux)

At the time of this writing, I was installing Barrier on a fresh install of Ubuntu 23.10.

1. Install Barrier from CLI

`sudo apt install barrier`

2. Open Barrier

3. Next on Welcome screen

4. Choose Server or Client

In this instance I chose Client, the other machine is acting as the Barrier Server.

5. Client Settings

By default, *Auto config* will be checked. My experience over the years with the *Auto Config* option has been hit or miss. So, I uncheck this. I have never used SSL with Barrier, seems overkill for my needs. I think it's good practice to operate software with minimal "bells and whistles," if you can get away with it. Extra features also means extra possible points of failure.

After unchecking *Auto config* I enter the IP address of the machine designated as the Barrier server.

Click __Start__

## SSL Error

The Barrier client (Linux) did not connect to the Barrier server (Windows). The logs show some static around an ssl certificate. The Barrier Server (Windows) does not require an SSL certificate from clients, it never has. The error is originating from the client (Linux).

Checking the settings of the client (Linux), we can see *Enable SSL* is checked. I forgot this is checked by default. Whoops.

*Enable SSL* turned off

The log is still throwing up errors. The solution is covered in the next post.
