## Have You Tried Restarting It?

I started by restarting the Barrier client on the "Server" (Windows 10) and the "Client" (Ubuntu 23.10). Any mention of SSL disappeared from the logs. However, the client would still not connect. Now when starting Barrier, I was getting a popup.*

*Apologies for the lack of a screenshot.

## No Wayland Support

>You are using a non-X11 window system (e.g. Wayland) which is currently not supported by Barrier. Several features will most likely not work properly. In order to solve this, you should log out, choose a X11/Xorg session at the login screen, and then log back in.

After browsing the [Issues](https://github.com/debauchee/barrier/issues) on Barrier's Github repo I confirmed that Barrier does not support Wayland.

## Changing the Default Display Manager

The default display manager is GDM3. We need to edit the *custom.conf* file and turn Wayland off.

`sudo nano /etc/gdm3/custom.conf`

Yes, I use `nano` instead of `vim`. I know, I know...

_Editing the custom.conf file_

Uncomment the *WaylandEnable=true* line and change it to *false*. Save and quit.

Restart or reboot the desktop using:

`sudo systemctl restart gdm3`

Verify the display manager is no longer showing up as Wayland.

`echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE`

Now when launching Barrier there is no error window. The logs are clean, and show a connection to the Windows 10 "Server" machine.
