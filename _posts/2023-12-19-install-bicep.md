## Setup a Bicep Developer Environment

Azure Bicep was announced at Ignite 2020. Bicep is Microsoft's (DSL) Domain-Specific Language that maps 1-to-1 with (ARM) Azure Resource Manager templates. Over the years, ARM templates have become increasingly complex and burdensome. Bicep is Microsoft's answer to this problem.

Done.

## Tasks

- [x] Install Bicep extension for Visual Studio Code
- [ ] Install Azure CLI
- [ ] Verify bicep developer environment requirements met

2. Next, we need to install the Azure CLI.*

<info>In the past, the Bicep CLI was separate from the Azure CLI. Microsoft has made things easier. Per the documentation, "Azure CLI automatically installs the Bicep CLI when a command is executed that needs it."</info>

Open the link to the MSI for the latest version of the Azure CLI:

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?tabs=azure-cli

Choose the release for your system, most likely the 64-bit option.

Once the installer is downloaded, open and click through (Next, Accept EULA, Install, Finish) the installation.

Done.

## Tasks

- [x] Install Bicep extension for Visual Studio Code
- [x] Install Azure CLI
- [ ] Verify bicep developer environment requirements met

3. Lastly, verify everything needed to author Bicep files from VSCode.

Verify the Azure CLI was installed correctly. Open Powershell and run the *az --version* command.

Now, if we try and verify our Bicep version, we get something like this...

Remember, the "Azure CLI automatically installs the Bicep CLI when a command is executed that needs it." We haven't run any commands that would automatically install the Bicep CLI. The prompt says to run *az bicep install*. Okay.

And running *az bicep version* is successful this time.

<tip>To make sure you have the latest Bicep version you can use the *az bicep upgrade* command.</tip>

## Tasks

- [x] Install Bicep extension for Visual Studio Code
- [x] Install Azure CLI
- [X] Verify bicep developer environment requirements met

And that's it, we have successfully verified all the requirements are met.
