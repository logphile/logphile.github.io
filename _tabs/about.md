About
Hi! My name is Tim but most people call me “Techno Tim” I create content on YouTube and Twitch.

Here you will find all the documentation for my YouTube videos on my channel https://www.youtube.com/technotimlive. This documentation is meant to compliment my videos and not replace them.

If you see something that needs to be fixed, this documentation is open source! Feel free to open an issue or PR here.

You can support this project by becoming a sponsor on GitHub or a patron on Patreon. Thank you for your consideration and for visiting!
