Hi, my name is Phil. This is my blog. 

My hope is that the content here will cover a range of technical topics. Ideally, stoicism, fatherhood, and other stuff too.

There are a couple of ways to reach me if you see something that needs to be corrected or just wanted to drop me a line.

Memento Mori,

Phil
