### **Hi, my name is Phil. This is my blog. My hope is that the content here will**
cover a range of technical topics. Ideally, stoicism, fatherhood, and other stuff too.

Stoicism is very valuable, easy to misunderstand and a difficult practice, at least in the beginning. Writing about Stoicism will help me internalize it better and maybe it will help someone reading one of my posts.  

There are a couple of ways to reach me if you see something that needs to be corrected or just want to drop me a line.

**Memento Mori**,

Phil
