Hi! I'm Phil. This is my blog. The content here is about technical stuff, stoicism, fatherhood and whatever else. 

I discovered Stoicism years ago, wish I had run across it earlier in life. I have found it to be very valuable. Stoicism is one of those things, easy to misunderstand but requires effort, discipline and mindfulness.

There are a couple of ways to reach me if you see something that needs to be corrected or just want to drop me a line.

**Memento Mori**,

Phil
